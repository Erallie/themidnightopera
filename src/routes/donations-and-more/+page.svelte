<h1>Donations and M</h1>
<DoubleBorder>
	<p>
		We rely on donations as well as art commissions to try and raise money for all the things we
		need. Such as new particles, props and eventually adding a VIP area or a second venue. Every
		dollar helps, so please donate or purchase a commission via the kofi linked below!

		Another good way to support us is through our merch store! All artwrk was hand drawn by Taia, the founder, herself!
		We have pins, mugs, stickers and more! The merch store will likely get new things often based on requests. 
		All purchases directly support our work, as all funds will go back into world/avatar creation and show maintenance!
